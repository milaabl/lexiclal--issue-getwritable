If you were to come to our house we'd count you as family.  In fact, that's my favorite description of the church it's family it's about relationships, it's about building community, and when you come to Cedar Ridge your family. Our mission is simple.  That's helping others follow Jesus. We're a multi-site Church with campuses in Broken Arrow and Coweta; allowing us to be a Community Church while at the same time making a global impact."

Small Groups help us make a large church smaller as we connect to each other, build relationships, and do life together. There are plenty of ways to volunteer at CRCC and we will help you find a great place to serve. We also have a new members class to help you make all the right connections with us.\n[Click Here to Find Your Next Step](/get-involved){: .btn .secondary}"
