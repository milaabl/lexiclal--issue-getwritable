It defines “who we are.” It’s a thread that should weave through every activity and ministry opportunity that we undertake. Simply put, our mission is our unique expression of the Great Commission.\n\nOur mission statement is:\n\n**Helping Others Follow Jesus.**\n\nEverything we do should stem from our mission of making disciples."

Spiritual growth takes place when studying God’s Word becomes a private discipline.\n\n### Every member is a missionary.\n\nWe encourage the rapid release of ordinary disciples into the world.\n\n### Spiritual growth happens in community.\n\nChristianity is best lived out in the context of relationships.\n\n### The Great Commission is global in scale.\n\nSo must our efforts as a church.\n\n### Family matters.\n\nFamily is one of the foundational institutions God uses to accomplish His mission.\n\n### The next generation is worth our sacrifice.\n\nEvery generation is significant but we will surrender our time, money, and preferences for children and students."
